But I didn't know brake dust was so much worse than tire wear in terms of it becoming airborne. And even with the added weight of EVs they still produce 38% less total brake, tire, and road wear emissions. 

So as we move to EVs, hopefully we can capture some of the tire wear particles in the drainage systems around interstates - but that will probably never happen. Or produce tires that pollute less.

muiafot,2025-05-27 21:52:37,electricvehicles,t1_mucyk4i,LeifCarrotson,"It's all about the press, and not about the actual numbers. 

The real costs of maintaining an ICE car may be higher, but people don't think about those costs when considering aggregate cost-per-year.

The annual cost of a car is the sum of, in approximately decreasing order: 

- Depreciation: (Purchase price - sale price) /  Average years of ownership

- Yearly insurance premiums

- Fuel costs, including fuel taxes

- Electricity costs

- Tire cost / Average years of tire life

- Unexpected repair costs (Alternators/belts/water pumps/AC/power steering pumps/ball joints that frequently wear out)

- Expected Maintenance costs (12V battery, oil changes on ICE, air filters, etc)

- Registration fees

- ""EV taxes"" (if applicable)

You can add all those things up, and then divide by average annual miles driven to get a cost per mile. 

Most people I know calculate cost per mile of a trip in their heads as just: 

    Miles driven / Miles per gallon * Fuel cost per gallon 

and ignore all the other factors, so a 100 mile trip costs 100 miles / 20 mpg = 5 gallons x $3/gallon fuel = $15 or $0.15/mile. In reality, it's more like $0.50/mile with all costs considered, and highly variable depending on the price, weight, and age of the vehicle. 

And as you say, most people just get an unpleasant surprise when they go to renew - this tax isn't relevant to their cost-benefit analysis except insofar as it comes pre-packaged in a shared feeling that ""EV taxes are expensive"". 

I feel it's also relevant to include the value of my time in the vehicle: When commuting, I'm not enjoying my time in the car. I'm not able to relax and read or multi-task like on public transport, and I'm not enjoying my time outside like on a bike, it's just precious minutes of free time slowly dribbling away. At work, I sell my time to my employer for a significant amount of money, and biology forces me to give away hours per day to sleeping and hygiene and eating (to the extent the latter is not pleasant), so my few hours of free time per day are quite valuable to me.",1,comment,2,,,,

mudnsfv,2025-05-27 02:55:19,electricvehicles,t1_muc6jz7,Brandon3541,"Honestly, it just sounds like you were driving a really old beater by your description....

For anything even vaguely new engine noise is negligible at highway speeds, jerky breaking means you just REALLY let the vehicle go maintenance-wise, and jerking also shouldn't happen during shifts. The last 2 in particular point to you not taking care of the car.

Lack of one pedal driving isn't a downside for most either, 1PD is a gimmick with no real benefit unless you are a more aggressive driver that doesn't break / coast very well. The commonly thought idea of it increasing range is false if you are already a decent driver, and that is unsurprising simply by virtue of physics and how the system works. It disables coasting (which is better than regen-braking in most scenarios), and it means you are performing more aggressive accelerate-decelerate cycles when not on cruise control as your foot naturally fluctuates positions. 1PD is really just a marketing ploy to make EVs feel special and futuristic.

Oh, don't get me wrong, EVs are on the road to being outright superior, you just listed reasons that DON'T matter.

Regen braking (not at all 1PD-only)  is nice as it reduces physical wear on the friction brakes, and ever so slightly increases range due to energy recovery.

The fact that its ""fuel"" is electricity means you have energy source independence, as electricity is electricity no matter how you make it, be it from coal, nuclear, hydro, solo or whatever, whereas a gas ICE can only take gas.

That previous point in particular means you can become 100% self-sufficient when it comes to powering your vehicle if you so desire.

EVs require less maintenance (which sounds like it is going to be a good thing for you judging from some of the issues you listed).

EVs have lower center of gravities due to their batteries, making them less rollover-prone

EVs have lower cost per mile with at home charging (more often than not, not true if using lv3 chargers though)

and probably some more I forgot off the top of my head.

EVs aren't PURELY superior yet though, because ICE (or EREVs by proxy) still reigns supreme when it comes to long distance trips and hauling heavy loads due to range, lack of planning needed to get from one place to the next, lack of the need to go out of your way to hit a gas pump on a trip, speed of filling up, amenities provided at gas stations, they suffer MUCH less during cold temperatures and at highway speeds, they have lower insurance rates, and they have much a greater number of service centers / much less wait time for repairs.

They will get there one day on most of these, but someone that wants to stay ICE for now can have very good reasons for doing so, heck, if I still travelled as much as I used to for work (multiple 10 hour trips per month, and many smaller multi-hour trips) I wouldn't have made the switch as it just wouldn't have made sense.",3,comment,2,,,,

They didn't bother to think / care about the fact that a 3000-lb vehicle on sport tires wears the road less than a 9000+lb truck on knobby tires, hence why I should be paying less tax on total gas for highway repairs. 

And it's a flat fee. When I was back in school a few years ago, I put maybe 1000 miles / year on it, and at a fee of $26.91/yr (if it's rated at 30mpg, which I think it is) that comes out to $0.80/gal in fees based on the actual ~30mpg it gets.

mt1o6an,2025-05-19 09:48:54,electricvehicles,t3_1kpocg5,Lost_Froyo7066,"This analysis is overly simplistic and flawed for many reasons as follows.

1. While the mean cost of electricity in the US may be $0.22 / kWh, the median is far lower as places like California and Hawaii skew the pricing very significantly. I believe that the average price of electricity in the US without those two states is in the range of $0.11 to $0.14 / kWh. Interestingly, the cost of gas in California and Hawii is also far higher than the average quoted above. Being closer to $5 to $7 per gallon depending on grade. Additionally, many EV drivers in those states have installed solar panels, which reduces their charging costs to near $0 (although there is some start up cost for the solar panels).

2. Most EVs do not compete with Honda Civic type vehicles, so making comparisons that include such vehicles again skews the results. For example, whether you agree or not, a Tesla Model 3 competes with BMW 3 series cars, which all require premium fuel, thus again raising the cost of comparable ICE operation. In general, EVs are targeted to compete with SUVs and high performance ICE vehicles that are lucky to get EPA ratings in the mid 20 mpg range on the freeway and frequently struggle to get ratings above 20 mpg in city driving. As further noted below, these ICE vehicle are lucky to get 5 to 10 mpg in their most frequent use cases (i.e., cold start, stop and go traffic, low speed short drive to do errands, cool off, rinse and repeat).

3. The majority of driving in the US is short trips for commuting or errands with lots of stop and go. Even cars with EPA mileage ratings of 30+ on the highway do not get close to this efficiency on 5 to 10 minute jaunts to the supermarket or longer trips with lots of waiting in traffic. Thus, the ""assumed ICE efficiency of 33 mpg"" is completely unrealistic. By contrast, EVs are most efficient in these circumstances, using almost no energy when sitting in traffic. Add to that the recent announcement by the US government on its plans to kill ICE start / stop mode and it gets worse as now the ICE will continue to run and suck gas the entire time the vehicle is not moving.

4. The proposed punitive federal use tax for EVs has not yet been passed into law and may not and even if it does, if / when Democrats regain some measure of control of the federal government, it is likely to be repealed or at least reduced. Also, not all states have implemented EV use taxes and even some that have (e.g., Virgina) have a system that charges by actual miles driven, not a flat fee. Thus, the suggested $500 annual tax is overstated.

5. Maintenance costs are much lower for EVs than for ICE and even more so than for hybrids. The nearly thousand fold less compexity and few moving parts in an EV drivetrain verses anything with an ICE is a huge benefit for EVs. They need less routine service, are less likely to have mechanical problem and overall are far cheaper to operate. While annecdotal, there are numerous reports of early producting Tesla Model S vehicles that were used in commercial transport (taxi, limo, etc.) that have gone over 300,000 miles with no drivetrain issues and minimal maintenance. The main things wearing out on those car are the interior upholstery and trim. ICE cars simply cannot compete in this regard.

This is not to say there is no place for very high efficiency ICE cars. As noted, things like Honda Civics that truly do get high mpg and run fine on regular as opposed to premium fuel are currently hard to beat. But again, that is not the market in which any EVs currently compete. When truly comparing apples to apples, even with the potentially punitive use taxes, EVs still make lots of economic sense compared to their true ICE competitors. And of course, this discussion completely ignores the social cost of ICE versus EVs and many people are willing to pay a bit more to help the environment.",4,comment,2,,,,

I guess it's a good thing most north americans don't buy fuel efficient cars or hybrids.

Look, I understand people are upset at fees, but a lot of people in this sub need to get a grip. It's not unreasonable to expect EV drivers to have to pay for stuff too. There is no data to show that these fees affect EV sales, just as there is no data that shows the EV tax credit expiring negatively affects sales either.

Almost no one buying a car cares what the registration fee is, or what the mileage is (unless gas prices are very high, which they aren't right now). People go in and buy the car they want. Carbuyers in fact are in record levels of debt and financial stress buying giant trucks/SUVs/luxury models they objectively don't need and can't afford even though there is no shortage of cheap options. A $250/year fee just isn't going to move the needle no matter what the chicken littles here say. No one walks into a dealer wanting to buy an EV and then sees a registration fees and walks away. That just doesn't happen.

If you want to propose an alternative, the best one is probably a tax on tires or some other consumption/wear items on cars. Arguing that there should be no EV tax at all no matter what is a non-starter and no one will take you seriously for it.",-3,comment,2,,,,

I'm retired, do about 500 miles a month on British rural roads, 98% of my trips are under 60 miles, the nearest petrol station is 8 miles away, we have 2 chargers in the village. I crunched the numbers comparing to ICE cars the same price.

Excluding Car Tax, brakes, suspension, tyres, steering, exhausts etc ICE car would cost about 14p per mile for fuel and about £125 a year for servicing so that would be £825 a year running costs or 16.5 ppm

EV costs I just had to look at what others were saying and make a guess and came up with 7ppm for fuelling, servicing (what's that? seemed to be the consensus) so £350 a year running costs ... but..  
I have solar panels, depending on the sun's angle and it actually making an appearance my output would reduce the charging cost or even zero cost. So let's say 6 months I average half my charging by solar, that's £87.50 reduction to £262.50 or  5.25 ppm, about 11ppm or £55 month cheaper than ICE.

I did a lot of reading and looking at cars online to see what was available. Ultimately it came down to what was available that was within an hour travelling.

I bought a 2017 Leaf Tekna 10 bars 80,000 in December for £3,700 by going to have a look and having a drive. Reasonable nick, heated leather seats, 360° low speed reversing camera but my, it's so quiet, I often drive without music on the Bose sound system just to hear how quiet it is... silence at traffic lights! It's also pretty nippy 😃

In winter when I was getting used to driving it I was getting about 70 miles @ 100% charge, in May I'm getting 95 miles. If I lived in a town or city I'd probably add an extra 10 miles easily to that.

And those motors generate high torque at low RPM and lower torque at high rpm. So they spin up and spin down smoothly.

And with regenerative braking, stop/start use cases don't use friction brakes as heavily.

So stop/start driving isn't as hard on EVs as it is on ICE cars.

EV's tend to burn through tires because of all that torque. (Tesla owners replace their OEM tires after 15K miles).

EV's tend to not need break pads as often if you use regen.

Piston based ICE vehicles have around 200 moving parts in the engine & transmission.  Tesla brags about 17 moving parts and the Mustang MachE has around 23 moving parts.

I’m not a mechanic by any stretch but I would be inclined to believe that parts like steering and suspension would have less wear due to potentially less aggressive turning and stopping and what are generally smoother road surfaces on the highway. Tires will generally wear more evenly with highway driving and with fewer stops and starts they will last a bit longer than those on a car mostly driven in town. 

There are a lot of other factors that are less relevant to EVs though, such as fewer cold starts, less wear on transmission, etc. 

In general, EVs tend to be more durable in general due to their nature of having far fewer moving parts.

mst49nq,2025-05-18 00:43:06,electricvehicles,t3_1kosxdf,AJHenderson,"No, it is exactly the opposite but generally less pronounced.  EVs don't use brakes much due to regenerative braking being highly effective.  However highway driving requires two major sources of wear that aren't as significant at low speed.  

1) electric motors are not geared so they run at much higher speed on the highway and this creates more resistance/heat. 

 2) In addition to this, the higher wind resistance combines with this to make much lower efficiency which means more power draw per mile.  More power draw per mile means more battery cycles which is the primary form of wear and tear of concern on an EV.

This is minor in comparison to how often the charge was above 80 percent or below 20 percent though.  (Both of which are also likely to be higher with lots of highway miles from long trips, but also could come very harsh from a local driver without access to home or work charging.)",1,comment,2,,,,

EV's do not run the engine idle, and every time they brake they recharge the battery.

Stop and Go traffic, Manhattan especially, is a dream for an EV.  

Also, by taking yet another ICE Vehicle out of Manhattan, you further reduce the noise pollution and the heat within the city caused by all the cars.

I honestly want the Next Mayor or Hochul to move further than Congestion Pricing, and just straight up issue an ICE Ban in Manhattan after 2027.  Yes that soon.  

A full car ban sans ride share and out of city deliveries really should be planned by 2035.

Sorry to say but, Manhattan was never designed with cars in mind, nor were half of the buildings in the city even put up when cars became mainstream.  

Cars, in general, do not belong in Manhattan at all.  The only reason a car should be in Manhattan is to pass through it to get to either Long Island, NJ, or Westchester - and should use the highways to avoid the city all together.

It has so much play in the steering that you can pretend to steer and continue in a straight line. It's so antiquated that it feels dangerous \[and it definitely isn't as safe as a modern vehicle\], but that adds to the fun because every journey is an adventure. Actually it's like using a campfire vs an induction cooktop. Lots of wasted energy and extra heat to take longer, but FIRE is pretty and when it's running right a V8 can sound so good. I think the key enjoying driving an ICEV now is to avoid boring cars and embrace the drama of ICE. My old truck is about 800 pounds lighter and on smooth roads can corner fairly well due to its stiff suspension and wide track, but the Lightning has a much bigger cab and way more safety and comfort goodies and far better weight balance and lower center of gravity. In a straight line, Thunder makes a bunch of noise spinning tires and revving while Lightning gets there silently and quicker.

I recently drove my wife's CMax hybrid for the first time since having my Lightning for 2 years. Pre-Lightning, coming from Thunder, the CMax was so comfortable, smooth, modern and economical. Thunder felt like having a ton of power on tap but it wouldn't come rushing in all at once. 40+ MPG vs 10 MPG though and the CMax could maintain 85 up the Grapevine while maxing out regen coming back down. At stops, and on downhills or in traffic, the engine would totally shut off and yet the AC kept blasting. It would go twice as far between fill-ups and each fill-up was half the time and cost. 

Post-Lightning, the CMax is less comfortable and smooth and is just BORING. And 90%+ even the quick small fillups are so much wasted time and expense vs just plugging in as I walk out of the garage into the house. On a long road trip relying on DCFC without destination charging, the cost is about the same Lightning vs CMax hybrid but the CMax is faster to refuel, less often. The Lightning can be more boring and easy to drive and has no drama until you bury your right foot. Then it feels like a launch coaster at Six Flags. One-Pedal is a gamechanger but so is brake hold. Not only do I not need to move my foot to another pedal except in emergencies, but I don't need to hold a pedal down to keep it from creeping up or rolling back. 

  
I also drove my Dad's Powerstroke F350 and while it has more peak power, it comes on so much more slowly until the turbo kicks in and spins the tires a bit.

I have to admit that I saw a way of cleaning up the environment with such a vehicle, and besides, I had a lot of faith in Honda, as the manufacturer. But I was loving the concept, not the reality. My brother said, ""H2 is not energy efficient overall. It may be abudant but it doesn't occur on Earth freely. It is always bound to something, like oxygen. It has to be freed up and compressed, and that takes far too much energy to be feasible"" Very quickly \[and disappointedly\] I realised that the H2 car was a practical non-starter. But it was what he said next that made me really attentive. He continued, ""You know, the electric motor and transmission in that H2 car could be really utilised if the battery in it was big enough to power the car alone. In fact, the electric motor has been waiting 100 years for the battery to catch up. But there has never been any political will or money to do the research before. But the time is coming.""

Listen up people.  Do a majority of people need to completely fill up their gas tanks every day?! 

No. So why does a solar panel have to completely charge a battery in a day?

The average driver goes about 20-30 miles a day.  It has been proven on prototypes by Toyota and a few other companies that plastering the entire top of a car (hood, roof and rear) with the best current solar cells can achieve up to 20 miles.  

So basically we are actually there now.  It doesn't have to get much better really just more cost effective. Also with increased motor and battery efficiencies, we might be able to squeeze more miles out of the current energy panels can make now.

Do you realize how many EVs would never need to charge if they can even charge 10 miles a day?!

But it's incredibly useful for now, and the economics of it are such that using too much less will drive the price up, leading to inflation like we saw when not just the price of gas but everything oil-related went up. In any case, the Saudis are on the board of all the green initiatives because they want to make sure that all green technology uses plastic and other petroleum-based products. Once it becomes too expensive to invest in new refineries and extraction for everyone but the middle east, we will be right back in the hole of being dependent on foreign oil, just not in the way we think of it now. And since plastic is in everything, it will be that much easier for the Saudis to control us politically. 

Also, just FYI, brakes and tires create a ton of toxic byproducts. It's ironic that while Teslas don't use gas, they market these extreme launches that cause wear to the tires and then the brakes when the driver uses them to slow down from the unsafe speeds. Also give noticed that Tesla drivers in general speed and drive relatively aggressively, weaving around and basically treating every other driver with less respect. And that driving style results in more tire wear and brake wear. Which are PM 2.5 particles that are fine enough to enter the bloodstream when inhaled, among other issues.

the rest of the car is 3 years, 36k miles.  I extended it out to 9 years/something.  so the battery is not the problem they want to charge for, everything else is

the car magnetically slows down the car.  no joke, the electric motor slows down the gas engine.  There’s reports of regenerstive breaking means pads last for many years.

my expectation is the gas engine needs notable wear and tear work long before the transaxle does because there’s no pieces that touch in the electric motor beyond gears.  and my car has three electric motors.  the one that runs the car, the one that runs the gas engine and the one that runs the back tires

That has caused it to wear to the belts while the sides have remained in tact, causing a visual inspection of only the sides to show that it had good tread left.

Aside from fairly low tread (they appear to be just above the wear bars, so 3/32 of tread at most, new is 10/32 for that tire), your tires are a hair over 6 years old. Most manufacturers recommend 5 years at most for a tire, and depending on where you live they can last significantly less.

I don’t disagree that it’s obviously safer to get new tires, but at this point it’s like arguing it’s safer to just get a new car because the suspension and weight and features make it safer. The tires are a high quality older tire getting really close to the end, 500 miles is fine.

Yes you should replace the tires, might be fine driving around but their performance is starting to degrade and the chance of a blowout is quite high.

Considering the high tread levels, maybe consider getting a faster wearing but higher grip tire (all tires rot regardless). 

Keeping the tires out of the sun is the main thing to help them last long.

You should not use automatic washes on your car, that is a good way to scratch it and some of them use harsh chemicals on your paint.

I have their thread life left for maybe 3-4 months and one tire smoothened out at places leading to vibrations while cruising. So I am looking into replacing tires now. The current tire dimensions are 235/40/R19. The ride right now is super bumpy, I can feel every little stone fallen on the ground on my ass everytime I drive.

I am looking for new tires that have more sidewall, so the ride is smooth, also looking for wider tires so I can have the same grip on the rode that I have now woth 235s. 

I went to a few stores to checkout deals, I was recommended 
1. Cooper Pro Controls,
2. Michelin Defender 2

Both the suggestions were given for 235/45/R19 so I can keep the same wheels and get new tires.

What are your suggestions?

musc6nv,2025-05-29 08:01:24,tires,t3_1kxuio0,66NickS,"The front tires do 100% of the steering, ~70% of the braking, and some amount accelerating in an AWD. The rears do 0% steering, ~30% braking, and some variable amount of accelerating. 

Basically, your front tires will experience more load/use/friction/etc.  This will cause them to wear more quickly.  This is often the worst in a FWD vehicle where the front tires do pretty much all of everything. 

The best thing to do is stay on top of your tire pressures and rotations.  Keep in the tire pressures properly set will help the individual tires wear as evenly as possible (assuming your alignment is good) and the routine tire rotations will help balance the wear from front to rear and right to left. 

There isn’t really a preventing this.  Tires are a consumable and wear/age.  They need to be replaced based on mileage or time/condition.   Driving conservatively, with proper pressure will reduce abnormal, excessive, or rapid wear.",2,comment,2,,,,

murpsip,2025-05-29 06:04:57,tires,t1_mupl6p2,ca_nucklehead,"A vacuum is a pressure that is below atmospheric pressure. Atmospheric pressure is 14.7 PSI at sea level. Since this is the pressure all around us, for measuring sake we use 14.7 PSI as relative 0. 

A fully inflated tire would be typically 35 PSI above relative 0. A flat tire would be 0 PSI or the same as the atmospheric pressure on the outside of a tire.

A tire is NEVER in a vacuum.
It is pressurized above atmospheric pressure or it is the same as atmospheric pressure when deflated.

Now let's talk about your theory of not being able to hear noise inside a pressure chamber (tire) even though you called it a vacuum. Do you sincerely believe that a lose bolt inside a tire at slow rotation is going to sound  louder at different air pressures or magic vacuums or that these pressures or magic vacuums are going to force that bolt against the carcass.

Let me tell you what will happen. 

At slow rotation the loose bolt will start at the bottom of the wheel against the carcass. 

As the wheel rotates the friction of the carcass against the bolt will allow the bolt to move with the tire until gravity overcomes the friction and the bolt falls to the bottom and starts over.  
As the rotational speed increases  inertia will overcome gravity and the bolt will be forced against the carcass and eventually match the speed of the rotating tire. 

Inertia and gravity keep a bolt against the carcass not pressure or magic vaccum.

Pressure has very little affect on sound waves and does not hold sound waves inside a pressurized chamber.

You are confused by the the absence of sound inside a true absolute vacuum like space where there is no atmospheric pressure.

1. 185 60 R14
2. 225 40 R18

In the first car we mounted Kumho All Season, while in the second one are mounted Michelin summer tires from the previous owner. With the first car we have already done 20,000 km and seeing the condition of the tires, it is almost time to change them, while in the second one they were changed recently. I am writing on this subreddit anyway because I would like some advice on the next tires. We would like to orient ourselves again towards all seasons, also on the second car. On the internet I had seen the Continental All Season Contact for the first car at a price of about 80 euros (I live in Italy). For the second one, I don't know what to choose, but I would like high-performance tires like the ones I mentioned above, but at a reasonable price. So, which tires would you recommend for these two cars? Are the ones I found good for the first one?

“Yes, it's generally recommended to replace tires after 8 years, regardless of tread depth. While some tires may still appear in good condition, rubber deteriorates over time, reducing grip and increasing the risk of blowouts. 
Elaboration:
Tire Aging:
Rubber compounds in tires are designed to provide a balance of grip, durability, and flexibility. However, over time, rubber dries out, hardens, and becomes more prone to cracking and cracking. 
Safety Concerns:
Even with seemingly adequate tread depth, older tires can be less effective in wet or icy conditions due to reduced grip and a higher risk of blowouts. 
Manufacturer Recommendations:
Most tire manufacturers recommend replacing tires after 6 years, and absolutely after 10 years, regardless of tread depth. Some manufacturers may recommend replacing tires sooner depending on the specific tire type and usage. 
DOT Code:
You can find the tire's date of manufacture (DOT code) on the sidewall, usually in the last four digits of the code. The first two digits indicate the week of manufacture, and the last two digits indicate the year. 
Signs of Aging:
Look for signs of dry rot, such as cracking or discoloration on the sidewalls or tread. You should also check for excessive wear and tear, as well as ensuring the tires are inflated to the recommended pressure. 
Consult a Professional:
If you're unsure about the condition of your tires, it's best to consult with a tire professional. They can assess the tires for signs of aging and advise you on whether they should be replaced. “",3,comment,2,,,,

I’m looking for summer tires for my car. I live in Greece, it rarely ever rains and temps are relatively high all year round, I don’t care too much about wet performance as I have a second car I can use in the event of really strong rainfall or snow, only other thing I care except from dry performance is mileage, I want them to last at least 30k km (20k miles)

My car is a Honda civic with 150hp so not too powerful but it gets driven pretty hard. However its 15 inch wheels mean that most new tires aren’t available. 
What I’ve found so far are: 
Continental Ultracontact,
Goodyear EfficientGrip Performance 1 (not 2)
Falken ziex ze310 
Bridgestone t005 
Hankook Venus prime 3
I also found Toyo’s proxes tr1 that many people say outperform the previous ones however they also say last a lot shorter.
Thanks in advance to anyone who took the time to read this and help!

	•	These bars appear when the tread wears down to approximately 1.6 mm, the legal minimum depth in many regions.
	•	Once your tread is level with these bars, it’s time to replace the tyres — regardless of how the rest of the tyre looks.

Your Current Tread Depth:
	•	You mentioned 5.6 mm tread remaining. That’s a healthy depth, especially after 24,000 km of use.
	•	Most new tyres come with 8–9 mm, so you’ve used about 30–35% of the tread life, which is normal and shows even wear — that’s good news.

At your current rate, you can likely get 45,000–55,000 km safely out of the set, depending on driving style and alignment.",1,comment,2,,,,

Cheap brands like Walmart LionHeart or the dirt cheap options on tire rack. I’ve bought them and the premium Pirelli, Michelin etc as a Uber driver who puts 40k a year on my cars

 If you are broke and don’t have enough money, buy the cheap shit to get by. But from my experience the LionHarts and other cheap brand have constantly had huge bubbles on the sidewalks after a pot hole. While the premium brands have not. Cheaper don’t handle as well in rain or snow. Also, seem to wear faster.

So you aren’t really saving $$$ due to replacement over time or a pothole. You are just spreading how much you have to pay over time. Which for some people are the only option. 

Many will hate this advice but if you want the best of both worlds (price/brand) you can get premium used brands (7 or 8/32nds) off eBay or united tire for the price of a new cheap brand.

Now the Defenders are designed for durability above everything but if you're someone like me who only drives 5000 miles a year they are gonna age/rot before the treads wear out anyways so might as well save a few hundred and get a set of Falkens (which is what I just did).

* How you drive
* Where you drive
* What you drive

If you drive a Tacoma somewhere with a temperate climate, smooth roads, and aren't racing around, you're gonna have great tire life with the majority of tires you can buy - the exceptions are tires geared for certain performance characteristics, like off road use, load rating, section width, etc.  Conversely, if you drive the same vehicle in the same climate and do more than drive easily on smooth pavement, you're going to get different treadwear and efficiency.  Live in a colder climate and you will likely see an increase in total treadwear, same if you live someplace hot.  Go on a lot of dirt or gravel roads and you get higher treadwear.

It’s about time to change the tires on my car (2018 Jeep Compass, 4X4) and I’ve narrowed it down to 3 options. After tons of research, I’ve narrowed my options to the: Michelin Cross Climate 2, Firestone Weathergrip and Nokian Outpost APT. 

The CC2 have been praised in virtually every review/thread I’ve read, but I’ve also read some mixed reviews about them in terms of how they handle in *real* winter weather (live in Canada). The Weathergrips seem to be more of a winter tire that you can run all year, with the most common complaints being that they don’t last as long (willing to sacrifice tread life for winter capability) and that they’re kinda noisy (aggressive tread, not a *huge* deal). 

What do we know about the Nokian Outpost APT? I love their rugged look, I love how they’re geared towards people who do 90% pavement driving but want *some* off road capability, I love the Aramid sidewalks and I love that they’re all weathers (3PMSF). Anyone running these? How’s their winter performance? Being as Nokian created the winter tire I assume they’re stellar, but I haven’t been able to find any reviews.

I didnt have the cash for new tires upfront as i’m in between pay periods and have no financing options due to credit. I went to a used tire shop and i was reluctant about 1 of the 2 they brought out as it had super low tread just looking at it but they wouldnt remount my tire as they showed me it had nails in the sidewall. 

The other tire of mine was straight up bald. The one with the nails had at least 5/32 tread. But i called a bunch of other shops and none had my size tire but this one. I got a tread checker and checked the two replacement used tires. One was 6/32 the other barely 4/32. 

Well i woke up this morning, so following day and the 6/32 one had zero air in it. I drove it half a mile to the gas station at a crawl and filled it up. Its sunday so that shop and almost all others are closed here. I took it to firestone being the only open tire shop and they said the used tire has a nail in the sidewall and is a slow leak but cant be repaired. 

I found two new tires on some tire site and i submitted to discount tire to price match it. $165 for continentals which is what i have on my rear anyways. Rears have 5/32. So i know those will need to be replaced soon too. My question is, how do i go about getting a refund for these junk used tires? Or do i just file a chargeback and explain they sold me a tire with a nail in it and almost zero legal tread. The used tires cost $65 a piece which i felt was steep but they wouldnt go down and there was nobody else that had affordable tires in stock. Even discount would have to order them in.

200s are great if you have the bank for them. I personally run 200s in the summer. I buy tires every year and it runs me about 1k each time. This is with track and dialing them. These IMO or the only real option for daily ability and insane performance. But it comes with a fair set of draw backs. But if you want performance a set of comp tires will not disappoint. 

Summers will have good grip but will not hold up as well as a 200 under extreme conditions. However it will at LEAST give you double the life of a 200 if not 3x to 4x longer.",1,comment,2,,,,

We purchased our Mazda about 14 months ago brand new from dealership (silly choice, we know now), and have since driven about 40k miles on it. We realize that the tires will need to be changed soon and are failing the penny test, and our dealership said in the last service that we should do it as soon as possible. The issue is that we have experienced a layoff in the family and our having to be extremely financially frugal. The dealership is quoting $800, and Monroe is quoting $600 for off-brand. We will also need a rotation.

We’ve been avoiding driving unnecessarily, but my husband does commute to work about an hour each way 4 - 5 days per week. 

Our question is, how dangerous is this? If we are able to stretch these a few more months while we save up, that would be ideal. We would feel most confident to be able to pay this in October without taking out debt for it. But of course it’s not worth an accident in the event of a blowout on the highway. What do you think?

I have a Suzuki Vitara Brezza with the stock steel rims and I’m planning to upgrade to alloy wheels. While doing that, I’m also considering a tyre size change. The stock size is 205/60 R16, but I’m thinking about going with 205/55 R17 or 215/60R17 instead since the top model comes with 215/60R16.

Now, I know increasing the rim size ideally means reducing the sidewall height to maintain the overall diameter, but I don’t want to compromise on comfort, so I want to keep the same sidewall ratio (60). This would give the wheels a better visual appeal, making them look bigger, and the Brezza has enough wheel well clearance to handle it.

What I’m concerned about is fuel economy since I drive it around 500kms every week. I assume the new tyres with 17” alloys would be about 2–3 kg heavier per wheel. How much would that realistically affect mileage? Would love to hear from anyone who’s done a similar upgrade, or anyone with insights into how noticeable the drop in fuel efficiency might be.

Any other significant side effects I should be aware of? Handling, braking, ride quality?

Thanks in advance!

mu3misr,2025-05-25 10:11:51,tires,t3_1ktvpv9,Warm_Feeling_5363,"Thanks for sharing all the details. You're doing the right thing by checking and getting second opinions. Here are a few things to keep in mind.

Even if the nail isn't causing a leak right now, there is still a risk, especially if it’s deep enough to reach the inner layers of the tire. Here's what could happen.

The heat and vibration while driving can cause the nail to gradually work deeper into the tire. As it shifts or gets hotter from road friction, it may eventually pierce the inner liner and create a slow or sudden air leak. If the puncture deepens suddenly at high speed, the result can be a rapid loss of pressure and that can lead to a blowout, especially on a highway. Even a very slow leak will leave you constantly monitoring tire pressure, and if it gets low unnoticed, handling, braking, and safety all suffer.

Since you're running Yokohama YK740 GTX tires at 40k miles with 6/32"" tread left, you’re near the wear point where traction starts to degrade, especially in wet weather. The fact that it's AWD complicates things, as a single replacement means matching all 4 tires to avoid drivetrain damage.

Short-term advice: If you're absolutely not replacing the tire now, monitor pressure daily. Fill it up if needed and avoid long or high-speed trips. If the leak worsens, patching from the inside might be possible, but that depends on the location of the nail. If it’s too close to the sidewall or shoulder, shops won't repair it. Don’t pull the nail out unless you're at a shop ready to plug or replace.

As a middle-ground solution, check eBay or tire resellers for a used or lightly worn Yokohama YK740 GTX with similar tread depth. Sometimes you can find one matching tire for $80–$150, which could save you from replacing the full set.

Long-term recommendation: If repair isn’t possible and no matching tire is available, consider replacing the full set with a more affordable option. It’s better than risking a blowout or damaging the AWD system over time.",1,comment,2,,,,

Also, you got taken at 4k miles. You didn’t have enough wear that a new tire would have been out of spec with the 3 others.

The issue you have to look out for is having more than 1/32 difference between any tires.

Up front to be honest, it would be best to go in and get a consultation. There is this really cool system we have called Treadwell and it can help visualize certain elements. For example, it will display road noise, how it handle in the rain and snow and so on and so forth. If price isn’t an issue and you live in an area with rain, snow and general bad winters, I would recommend the cross climate 2. They are very quiet, we usually put them on teslas. They handle amazing in the snow and rain, and they are estimated for about 50k miles. They are a solid tire, but if you live somewhere with little rain, I wouldn’t recommend them. They are mainly used for bad weather conditions. Something else that’s pretty cool is you can play around with the size of your tire and slightly alter the size. Honda ( and all car companies for what it’s worth) send us tire fitment guides, so different but close sizes that will fit with no issue. That’s a slightly uncommon size but you can change it up like for example staying with a 18 inch rim but making it a 235/55/18. I don’t know if you already know this but the first number is the width, the second number is the height, the last number is the wheel size. Changing the size is very slight and basically unnoticeable, we are talking millimeters. I hope this helped! I’d be happy to help out any other way I can, some info to best gave me help you narrow down to a specific tire would be.

They provide grip and traction, allowing for better control, especially in adverse weather. Well-maintained tyres also contribute to reduced rolling resistance, improving fuel consumption. 
Here's why good tyres are essential:
Safety:
Tyres are the only point of contact between your vehicle and the road. They provide grip and traction, which are critical for maintaining control, especially in wet or slippery conditions. Worn or underinflated tyres can lead to reduced traction, increasing the risk of skidding or sliding. 
Performance:
Good tyres enhance handling, cornering, and braking capabilities. They help to translate your steering and acceleration actions into actual road contact. 
Fuel Efficiency:
Properly inflated tyres with adequate tread depth reduce rolling resistance, meaning the engine doesn't have to work as hard to propel the vehicle, resulting in lower fuel consumption. 
Comfort:
Tyres also contribute to a smoother and more comfortable ride by absorbing road shocks and vibrations. 
Durability:
Quality tyres are designed to withstand the rigors of regular driving and provide longer-lasting performance. 
Weather Conditions:
The right tyres can make a significant difference in handling various weather conditions, such as rain, snow, or ice. JUST A FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH PEACE OF MIND FOR NEXT FEW YEARS‼️👍🙏",-4,comment,2,,,,

Firstly, the Cybertruck weighs about 6600 pounds. A little bit more than an F250 crew cab or a RAM 2500. Their cars are all roughly between 3500 and 5,000 pounds. The Cybertruck is shit, it's a massive piece of shit for a massive multitude of reasons, but the weight alone really isn't one.

Secondly, you're referring to EV tires, which are not exclusive to Tesla. The only real difference between EV tires and normal tires are that EV tires use a slightly harder compound. You can run normal tires on an EV, they'll just wear out sooner. And they're not 10x as expensive. They can be about 25-50% more per tire, but they last for about the same distance as a conventional tire does on a conventional ICE vehicle. I drive what in the US is considered a compact car. My car weighs less than 3,000 pounds, but each individual tire is rated for 1600 pounds. That means if I could get my tires to fit, I could theoretically put them on a Model X long range, Tesla's heaviest car. They would wear out much quicker, probably not even lasting 15,000 miles, because they're not EV tires, but they could work.

Defender 2s are great for long life but actually lack wet, dry, and snow traction. It's still good, but michelin's crossclimate 2 or other competitors with less life offer way more performance. 

Defender 2s are warrantied for 80k miles so you must drive a lot considering tires usually only last 4-6 years before they rot. If you're under warranty, use it. Also consider an alignment if your car is prematurely wearing tires, checking air pressure, and suspension problems. Also it's important you drive smoothly. Hard turns, acceleration, and braking can easily take off hundreds of miles on a tire even if you do it one time, any squealing is money down the drain.

* **Measured Depth:** Approximately **3.2 mm** (0.13 in) remaining
* **% of New Tread:** \~40 %

**Surface Inspection**

* **Cracks & Dry‐Rot:** Fine “crazing” cracks visible across the tread blocks and along the sidewall—signs of aging rubber that can lead to sudden failure.
* **Punctures/Foreign Objects:** No nails or embedded debris found in these images.
* **Uneven Wear:** Slightly more wear down the center of the tread, indicating possible over-inflation.

**Age Estimation**

* **DOT Code Readout:** “0117” (Week 1 of 2017) → Tire is over **6 years old**.

Our current tires are Hankook Dynapro HP2 235 60 R18 103H. I don’t dislike them or anything. They simply need to be replaced soon. We bought the car with 7500 miles and they likely came with the car. We’re at almost 30000 miles snd will probably replace at next oil change at 33000. 

We live in Florida so driving conditions are mostly hot and wet. 

I am looking at other tires too, but the Pirelli’s seem like a great price at Sam’s club right now for just under $800 for the tires and installation for what they are (3rd ranked tire in its’ category on tirerack.com), so I’m really just wondering if there’s anything to consider with the differences in the tire ratings, meaning the XL, and the 107V. It seems higher load and speed rating is fine, but I’m wondering if there will be a difference in the feel for the ride. 

Also would you go ahead and replace all 4, even if two of them had a little more life in them? I’d probably replace the last two at around 38000 miles if I didn’t replace all 4 at once.

I do a lot of spirited drives, backroad runs, twisties and such, so I would love to get the most out of cornering and handling with wider, thinner tires. On the flip side, I also daily this car everywhere and it's my only mode of transportation.

I wanted to ask around to see if anyone has had experience with a similar change and whether it was worth it. Was the ride significantly rougher? Was the difference not really noticeable? How much wider do you actually need to go in order to feel a major difference? I'd love to hear more personal experiences.

additional information, ill be going from **Yokohama Advan Sport A/S+** Performance All-Season Tires to **Continental ExtremeContact Sport 02** High Performance Summer Tires. im also lowered on lowering springs with aftermarket front sway bar links, rear sway bar, rear camber kit, and a strut bar.

2. Ten years is a maximum.

Obviously heavy car, in the rain with brand new tires can outperfom a light shitbox with totally worn tires.

Two the same cars in the rain: one with young, but almost worn (but still perfectly legal) tires and the other with these. Guess what car would aquaplan sooner?
